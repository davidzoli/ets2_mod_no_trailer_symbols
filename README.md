## Description:

Here is some expansion for the "find your trailer" must have mod for who like challenges

![Image of mod](https://github.com/davidzoli/ets2_mod_no_trailer_symbols/blob/master/workshop-files/no_trailer_symbols.jpg?raw=true)

During the uploading - when attach the trailer - the mark is invisible now. Your job to find your trailer.
The unloading has changed too. The lines disappeared. Two standing barriers (or cones) show you the place, where you have to part the trailer. To make it parallel to things is you job, just in real life.
